PizzaOrder.prototype.calculatePrice = function() {
  this.basePrice = 5;
}

The PizzaOrder always starts at a base price of $5

The size and toppings chosen will change the cost of the pizza afer that, so...

the for loop below should loop through the properties in the pizza pushed to the PizzaOrder array to determine which size it contains to generate the cost


for (pizza size index
if pizza.size === "small"
  basePrice += 4.99;
else if pizza.size === "medium" 
  basePrice += 6.99;

for (pizza toppings index



the for loop above should loop through the properties in the pizza pushed to the PizzaOrder array to determine which toppings it contains to generare the cost --- how to determine which checkboxes are checked?


totalPrice should = basePrice + calculatedPrice

calculatedPrice = size input + toppings input

once totalPrice is formulated correctly, then probably make PizzaOrder.prototype.displayTotalPrice() method
  then, link that value to HTML output
